# Super Marcos - Platformer Game Sketch

This is a basic sketch of a Super Mario-like platformer game built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It can be played directly in a web browser.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. Use the arrow keys to move the player left and right.
3. Press the spacebar to jump.
4. The goal is to navigate the platforms without falling off.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- CSS for styling

No additional dependencies are required. This is a single-player browser game. For multiplayer features, additional setup with a server (e.g., using Node.js and Socket.io) would be needed, but this sketch is kept simple.

Enjoy playing! # super-marcos
